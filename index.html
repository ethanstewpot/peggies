            Its christmas in Peggy Land and all the Peggies are in full
            Christmas spirit. Sparkly stuff has been hung all around the park,
            the scent of pine, cinnamon, and mild confusion hangs in the air.
            For the <span class="playpeggie_inline">PLAYPEGGIE</span> Peggies,
            Christmas is not just a season but a mindset. A mindset that
            includes glitter, poor decision making and eating veggies in
            concerning quantities.

                    Eusebio has found some presents, lucky Eusebio! Eusebio
                    likes presents but doesn't understand exactly how they work.
                    He has tried turning the boxes upside down and gently
                    shaking them, a technique he believes is “part of the
                    ritual.” Eusebio is particularly drawn to presents that
                    rattle, which he suspects may contain delicious treats or at
                    least the idea of treats. While the concept of giving
                    remains unclear to him, Eusebio is deeply committed to the
                    aesthetic of presents, particularly those with tasty paper
                    and unnecessarily elaborate bows.

                    It’s snowy outside and Peggy Land has been transformed into
                    a winter wonderland, how exciting! Delores has found a
                    snowman with a lovely carrot for a nose. She admires its
                    colour, crunchiness and girth. Delores loves a nice big
                    carrot. Delores is the embodiment of a modern Peggie woman,
                    unafraid of desire and always ready to make bold vegetable
                    based choices.

                    The Peggies have gone to New York for a bit of last minute
                    christmas shopping. These Peggies really like shopping,
                    especially with the
                    <span class="playpeggie_inline"> PLAYPEGGIE</span> credit
                    card. From luxury Pig-loo accessory stores to festive tunnel
                    pop-ups, no boutique was spared. Laden with bags of
                    christmas scented pea flakes and an alarming amount of
                    snowflake shaped pepper slices, they have stopped off at
                    Central Park for a spot of ice skating, because nothing says
                    “holiday glamour” like wobbling elegantly in inappropriate
                    footwear. Such elegant and graceful Peggies!

            Winter can be a challenging time for Peggies, which is why seasonal
            wellness is more important than ever. Experts recommend starting
            each morning with a moment of quiet reflection and a very damp leaf
            of lettuce. Carrots are encouraged for confidence, cucumbers for
            balance, and cabbage for emotional resilience. <br />
            <span class="playpeggie_inline">PLAYPEGGIE</span> top festive tip: A
            delightfully rejuvenating face mask can be made by soaking pellets
            in the water bowl overnight! <br />Peggies are reminded to listen to
            their bodies, moisturise their paws, and never suppress a craving
            for something crunchy. True wellness, after all, comes from within
            and occasionally from a well-timed radish.
