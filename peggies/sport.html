                The Peggies’ goal in life is to look fabulous at all times, and
                today is no exception. Having collectively agreed that sweat is
                merely another accessory, all the Peggies have headed out to
                enjoy their favourite sporting activities, fully styled, lightly
                hydrated, and emotionally supported by snacks. In Peggie Land,
                sport isn’t just about competition; it’s mostly about commitment
                to the look.

                    Bernarda loves to keep in shape by skating around looking
                    glamorous and listing to her favorite tunes. Wearing roller
                    skates that absolutely do not prioritise safety, Bernarda
                    glides effortlessly along the promenade, her walkman
                    blasting pepper ballads and carrot anthems. Her movements
                    are fluid, confident, and mostly intentional. Bernarda
                    doesn’t skate for fitness; she skates for presence.

                    Petronila and Pancracia love to play tennis, they find it to
                    be the most sophisticated way to play with balls. Dressed in
                    crisp whites and carrying themselves with the seriousness of
                    Peggies who once watched a documentary about Wimbledon, they
                    take their rallies very seriously. Inspired by Bernarda’s
                    fearless glamour, they’ve decided to elevate the experience
                    by attempting tennis on roller skates. What could possibly
                    go wrong? Fashion editors predict chaos, elegance, and at
                    least one dramatic pause for breath and cucumber water.

                    Meanwhile, Aniceta is leading the peggie Aerobics class.
                    Clad in neon, leg warmers, and motivational optimism,
                    Aniceta counts loudly and confidently, even when no one is
                    quite sure what number they’re on. Arms flail, hips shimmy,
                    and dignity stretches thinner than worn out Lycra. Aniceta
                    reminds everyone that it’s not about perfection; it’s about
                    commitment, coordination, and remembering to look fabulous
                    at all times.

                    Isidro has decided to work on his peggie pecks, he wants to
                    have the biggest chest in Peggie Land. Isidro approaches his
                    workout with focus, ambition, and absolutely no sense of
                    form. Each lift is followed by a mirror check and a quick
                    snack break. Isidro’s approach to sport is instinctive,
                    treat focused, and refreshingly non-committal. Come back
                    soon to check on his progress!

                    continues lifting with passion, confusion, and mediocre
                    technique. He goal is to come top in the 800g weight class
