                Its Cocktail evening in Peggie Land! As the sun sets over Peggie
                Land, the air is thick with sophistication, carrot cubes clink
                dramatically, and someone has definitely over-muddled a
                cucumber. The Peggies have slipped into their finest evening
                looks, accessorised with confidence, ambition and a suspicious
                amount of parsley. This is not just cocktail hour this is the
                <span class="playpeggie_inline">PLAYPEGGIE</span>
                lifestyle.

                    Encarnación has found a delicious martini and a lovingly
                    curated platter of her favourite veggies, arranged with the
                    care of a Michelin-starred salad bar. There’s fennel for
                    flair, carrot batons for crunch, and a daring hint of
                    radicchio for emotional depth. Encarnación is living the
                    Peggie dream life, gently swirling her drink while
                    contemplating which vegetable truly gets her. Spoiler: it’s
                    celery.

                    Manolo is making sure all the Peggies stay refreshed with
                    lovely cocktails. Wearing an expression of calm authority
                    and a garnish tucked discreetly behind one ear, Manolo moves
                    through the room like a well-trained salad sommelier. His
                    signature drinks are balanced, bold, and extremely celery
                    heavy, with a citrus twist that says “I care about
                    digestion.” Peggies whisper that he once mixed a drink so
                    refreshing it realigned someone’s chakras and their snack
                    priorities.

                    After a hard day of looking fabulous, there’s nothing
                    Concepción likes more than taking a well-deserved rest by
                    sipping a sophisticated long drink. Reclining elegantly,
                    Concepción nurses her glass like it’s a trusted old friend,
                    complete with an artisanal cucumber spear and a sprig of
                    dill for drama. She believes rest is essential, hydration is
                    sacred, and cocktails should always contain at least one
                    vegetable pretending to be decorative.

                    Garnish: baby carrot, dramatically oversized<br />
                    Bright, bold, and excellent for eyesight and gossip. Best
                    enjoyed while pretending you can taste the terroir.

                    This drink whispers, “I’m hydrated, but make it fashion.”
