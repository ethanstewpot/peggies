                Its Summer in Peggie Land and all the Peggies are looking
                glamorous at the beach. The sun is shining, the sand is warm and
                the lettuce is floppy. Booties are oversized, expectations are
                low and hydration is taken very seriously, mostly in the form of
                crisp, delicious cucumber slices.

                    on his big fancy sail boat. With one paw on the wheel and a
                    firm commitment to looking stylish, Cándido embodies
                    effortless coastal cool. As the boat glides through the
                    water like a peeled cucumber through butter, the Peggies
                    lounge on deck pretending they understand sailing terms.

                    Sipping a tasty carrot smoothie and contemplating absolutely
                    nothing, Anselmo demonstrates peak summer wellness. His
                    current responsibilities include rotating slowly like a
                    sun-warmed chicory and reaching for snacks without sitting

                    Peggiehoff is keeping guard from his lifeguard tower. From
                    his elevated position, David scans the horizon with the
                    intensity of a Peggie who will notice if a cucumber goes
                    missing. David likes being on the tower because the wind
                    makes his hair look even more epic. The breeze lifts his
                    hair into a state best described as “structurally unsound
                    but heroic.” Safety has never looked this glamorous.

            To keep in shape the peggies are playing Volley ball. Its important
            for the Peggies to maintain their ripped beach bodies. Leaps are
            attempted, balls are missed and everyone agrees it still counts as
            exercise. The Peggies believe fitness is about movement, teamwork
            and rewarding yourself afterward with something leafy. After all,
            nothing squeaks “summer body” like feeling good, staying hydrated
            and being at least 60% salad.

            This summer, Peggie fashion is all about confidence, ventilation and
            leafy vegetable accessorising. The modern Peggie knows that true
            style isn’t about trends, it’s about committing fully to a look,
            even if that look involves lettuce.

                    Oversized sunglasses remain essential, not just for eye
                    protection but for maintaining an air of mystery while
                    chewing. Straw hats are in, particularly those slightly too
                    big and at risk of falling off in a strong breeze. For
                    evening glamour, nothing elevates an outfit quite like a
                    carefully chosen sprig of parsley worn purely for effect.

                    bikinis, and anything that says “I may nap at any moment”
                    are all approved. Colours inspired by tasty snacks dominate
                    the palette; carrot orange, cucumber green, and the always
                    daring aubergine.

                    No Peggie look is complete without a statement vegetable.
                    Think celery as a clutch, radishes threaded like jewellery,
                    or a casually carried corn cob for that effortless “I just
                    threw this on” vibe. Remember: the vegetable should look
                    intentional, even if it will be eaten later.

                    pea flakes. Comfort is key, if you can’t sprint toward
                    snacks at a moment’s notice, it’s simply not practical

            The Final Word Summer fashion in Peggie Land is less about rules and
            more about feeling good in your own fur. If your outfit flaps
            slightly in the wind and smells faintly of salad, you’re doing it
            right.
